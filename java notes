ResultSet executeQuery(String sql) throws SQLException :
This method is used for SQL statements which retrieve some data from the database. For example is SELECT statement. This method is meant to be used for select queries which fetch some data from the database. This method returns one java.sql.ResultSet object which contains the data returned by the query.

This method is used for SQL statements which update the database in some way. For example INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE statements. All these statements are DML(Data Manipulation Language) statements. This method can also be used for DDL(Data Definition Language) statements which return nothing. For example CREATE and ALTER statements. This method returns an int value which represents the number of rows affected by the query. This value will be 0 for the statements which return nothing.
